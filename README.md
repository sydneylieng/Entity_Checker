# Entity_Checker
Project created during Co-op Term at Teknion. Symbols are 2D/3D drawings that represent Teknion Products. There are certain properties that these 2D and 3D drawing can have; therefore, I created this scripts that runs through multiple 2D/3D drawings and checks whether the entities within the drawing are of the correct property. 

1. checkEntities: The AutoLISP script that is read by AutoCad to determine if the drawing contains the correct entities.
2. create_dwg_list: This is the batch file that will create a list from your folder.
3. Entity_Checker_Template: Here's where you'll fill in all your information about your drawings to create the script that runs the AutoLISP Script on different drawings. 
4. Entity_Project_Documentation: This gives the rundown of the Project. 
5. usefulLinks: Just a list of "useful links" if you want to deal with AutoCad commands. A really good link to debugging AutoCad.
6. VBA Code: This helps create the script that runs the AutoLISP Script (already incorporated into the Entity_Checker_Template).
